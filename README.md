Workshop in compile-time techniques for detecting Javascript exploits.

To run the project, please load the workshop directory, including all its sub-directories, into eclipse - and run the UserInterface.py file.

We created a nice and simple UI which allows the user to paste the scripts or load them from an existing file. Just click and play :-)
